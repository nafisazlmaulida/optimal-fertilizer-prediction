# 🌱 Optimal Fertilizer Prediction - Kaggle Playground S5E6

This repository contains my solution for the [Kaggle Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 6](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e6/overview).  
The objective is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the most suitable fertilizer for a given agricultural condition.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Using environmental and soil features, predict the **optimal fertilizer type** from a set of predefined classes. The dataset is synthetic but designed to mimic real-world agricultural scenarios.

## 📊 Features
- Soil nutrients (e.g., Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)
- Environmental conditions (e.g., Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall)
- Crop type and other agronomic variables

## 🔍 Goal
Build a classifier that accurately assigns the best fertilizer for each sample, helping optimize agricultural productivity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost / LightGBM
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `notebooks/eda.ipynb` for data exploration
4. Run `src/train_model.py` to train the model
5. Submit `submission.csv` to Kaggle
